"Unlike Selenium, Playwright has built-in auto-waiting. No more manual waits or sleep statements that make tests unreliable."

### Live Demo (3 min)
1. "Let's see this in action with our juice shop application"
2. Show test file structure
3. Run: `npm run test`
4. Highlight auto-waiting in console output
5. Show cross-browser execution
6. Generate report: `npm run report`
7. Show beautiful Allure report

### Wrap-up (30 sec)
"Playwright eliminates the #1 cause of test failures - timing issues - while providing true cross-browser testing capabilities."
