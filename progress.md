- **Current Status:** None created
- **Impact:** Major grade reduction (20% of total marks)
- **Action Required:** Create slides covering 4 required areas

#### 2. **Adoption Evidence Research (WEAK - HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Required:** "How widely used (adoption evidence: ecosystem, community, notable users)"
- **Current Status:** No research on Playwright's industry adoption
- **Impact:** Affects 30% of marks (Features & Usage criterion)
- **Action Required:** Research Microsoft backing, companies using it, GitHub stars, npm downloads

#### 3. **Differentiator Emphasis (NEEDS IMPROVEMENT)**
- **Required:** "Show at least one differentiator"
- **Current Status:** Auto-waiting is implemented but not explicitly highlighted vs Selenium
- **Action Required:** Make comparison more prominent in demo

#### 4. **Team Participation Plan (UNCLEAR)**
- **Required:** Each student must present part of work
- **Current Status:** No clear role assignment
- **Action Required:** Define who presents slides vs demo

## Rubric Assessment (Current vs Potential)

### **1. Introduction & Context (20%)**
- **Current:** Average (55-69%) - Missing industry context
- **Potential:** Very Good (85-100%) with adoption research
- **Gap:** Need Playwright's Microsoft backing, major adopters

### **2. Features & Usage (30%)**
- **Current:** Good (70-84%) - Features shown, workflow clear
- **Potential:** Very Good (85-100%) with adoption evidence
- **Gap:** Need ecosystem data (npm downloads, GitHub stars, market trends)

### **3. Live Demo & Code (30%)**
- **Current:** Very Good (85-100%) - Working, reliable, professional
- **Potential:** Very Good (85-100%) - This is our strength
- **Gap:** Minimal - maybe emphasize differentiators more

### **4. Presentation Quality (20%)**
- **Current:** Unknown - No materials created yet
- **Potential:** Very Good (85-100%) with proper preparation
- **Gap:** Everything - slides, structure, timing, team roles

## Technical Implementation Status

### **✅ Completed Technical Features:**
- Auto-waiting implementation (key differentiator)
- Built-in screenshots/videos capture
- Sequential test execution for demo flow
- Allure reporting with visual evidence
- Cross-browser configuration (Chrome focus)
- Modern selector usage (text, CSS, data-testid)
- Comprehensive error handling and troubleshooting
- Port flexibility (3000/3001/3002 auto-detection)
- Clean test results between runs

### **✅ Assessment Requirements Met:**
- **Quick Setup:** 3-command installation ✅
- **Working Code Example:** 6 test cases ✅
- **Key Features Demo:** Assertions + Fixtures + Reporting ✅
- **Differentiator Shown:** Auto-waiting vs Selenium ✅
- **Source Code:** Complete implementation ✅
- **Setup Instructions:** README with troubleshooting ✅

## Action Plan (Priority Order)

### **URGENT (Complete by [Date]):**
1. **Create 5-slide presentation:**
   - Slide 1: What is Playwright? (Purpose & Domain)
   - Slide 2: Core Features (Auto-waiting, Cross-browser, etc.)
   - Slide 3: Workflow & Setup
   - Slide 4: Industry Adoption (Microsoft, Netflix, etc.)
   - Slide 5: Demo Overview

2. **Research adoption data:**
   - GitHub stars, npm weekly downloads
   - Companies using it (Microsoft, VS Code team, Netflix)
   - Comparison to Selenium market share
   - Community size and ecosystem

### **HIGH PRIORITY:**
3. **Plan team roles:**
   - Assign who presents slides (3 min)
   - Assign who does live demo (3 min)
   - Practice transitions and timing

4. **Enhance demo script:**
   - Emphasize auto-waiting vs Selenium explicit waits
   - Highlight built-in screenshot/video capture
   - Show Allure report features

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
5. **Prepare for Q&A:**
   - Common questions about Playwright vs Selenium
   - Technical implementation details
   - Tool limitations and use cases

6. **Create fallback plan:**
   - Record demo video as backup
   - Test all commands beforehand
   - Have alternative examples ready

## Current Grade Estimate

**Without Fixes:** 70-75%
- Strong technical demo (30% criterion = 85-100%)
- Weak presentation materials (20% criterion = 0-39%)
- Good features but missing adoption (30% criterion = 70-84%)
- Unknown presentation quality (20% criterion = TBD)

**With All Fixes:** 85-90%
- Excellent technical demo (30% = 85-100%)
- Strong presentation materials (20% = 85-100%)
- Comprehensive features + adoption (30% = 85-100%)
- Professional presentation (20% = 85-100%)

## Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK:**
- No presentation slides = Automatic significant grade reduction
- Missing adoption research = Fails "widely used" requirement

**MEDIUM RISK:**
- Poor team coordination = Reduced presentation quality marks
- Technical demo failure = Major impact on 30% of grade

**LOW RISK:**
- Minor timing issues = Small deduction
- Q&A struggles = Minimal impact

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Start slide creation (today)
2. **Research:** Gather Playwright adoption data (this week)
3. **Practice:** Rehearse presentation and demo (before presentation date)
4. **Backup:** Create fallback materials and test setup
